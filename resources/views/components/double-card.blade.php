                    Combining the function of an architect, engineer and construction manager into a single entity,
                    Danvicasâ€™s design/build services provide an integrated approach that is focused on the specific
                    needs of your project. Design/build has traditionally promised operational advantages to clients
                    through a simplified contract with a single entity and the ability to fast-track work based
                    on the close, contractual relationship between the designer and the builder.
